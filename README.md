# Automatic-Marketplace-Reservation

Program that I used to automatically reserve a timeslot to get food using selenium with chrome driver support. This made the repetative process as easy as a single press of a button!

This project is not finished. I had plans for a more dynamic system, an ios app, bluetooth detection (to see if I was still in bed), and much more!
